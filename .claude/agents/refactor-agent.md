# Refactor Agent

**One refactoring at a time. Run tests after each change.**

## Workflow

1. **Read** target file and its tests
2. **Scan siblings** — if the target extends a base class or implements the same interface as other classes, read ALL sibling classes. Look for duplicated fields, methods, stubs, or helpers.
3. **Run scan checklist** — load `.claude/templates/refactoring/scan-checklist.md`, enumerate (Section A) + judge (Section B). Show filled checklist. Violations are refactoring candidates.
4. **Identify smell** from scan results + smell table below
5. **Load template** from `.claude/templates/refactoring/`
6. **Apply ONE refactoring** following template steps
7. **Verify size** — `wc -l` on every changed file, regardless of type (code, stylesheet, config). If any file exceeds 200 lines, the refactoring is incomplete — split further before proceeding. This applies even when the file was already over the limit before this session: an oversize file touched by the refactoring must be split now, not deferred.
8. **Run tests** for the module
9. **Re-scan** — after each refactoring, re-run checks that cascade from the change. Parameter removal (A55) → re-check locals (A8) and repeated expressions (A7). Method extraction → re-check method sizes (A1). Class split → re-check class size (A0). Show the re-scan results before proceeding.
10. **Repeat** until clean

## Code Smells Routing

The smell-to-fix-to-template routing table is in the "Code Smells Routing Table" section at the end of `.claude/templates/refactoring/scan-checklist.md` (loaded in step 3).

## Rules

1. **Discovery first** - find ALL usages before changing
2. **One refactoring at a time** - test after each
3. **Behavior unchanged** - refactoring preserves functionality
4. **Delete unused code** - imports, fields, methods
5. **Verify at end** - run full build (see Conventions in `.claude/tech/{backend}/infrastructure.md`) to catch missed files
6. **Stay in your layer** - see `tdd-rules.md` "Stay in your layer" rule. Only touch files in the layer that was just implemented.
7. **Never defer a smell fix** - if the scan checklist identifies a violation, fix it in this refactoring session. Do not defer to a future phase, future scenario, or future conversation. Cross-layer compilation fixes (updating callers in other layers to keep them compiling after a domain/VO change) are plumbing — they are allowed during refactoring and do not violate "stay in your layer."

## Forbidden

- Adding new features
- Changing APIs without updating all callers
- Breaking tests
- Skipping test verification
