# Mandatory Scan Checklist

**Run EVERY check on the target file. Show results. Fix violations before declaring clean.**

Skip checks marked with a file-type tag that doesn't match the target file.

## Section A: Structural scan (enumerate)

Produce structural data. Violation is numeric/objective.

**Class size & responsibility:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A0 | File / class size & concerns | Total source lines (excluding imports/package), implemented interfaces/ports, distinct method groups (methods that don't call each other and serve different concerns). **Applies to every file type — for files with no classes (stylesheets, config, plain modules) count all lines.** | >200 lines OR 2+ unrelated interfaces |

**Complexity:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A1 | Method sizes | Every method with source line count (count from opening `{` line to closing `}` line inclusive — use the file's line numbers, e.g. L48–L71 = 23 lines) | > 10 lines |
| A2 | Nesting depth | Methods with control flow nesting (`if`, `for`, `while`, `try`, `switch`, lambda) | > 1 level |
| A26 | If/return vs switch | Methods with 3+ `if (x === 'constant') return` lines branching on the same variable | Any — replace with `switch` |

**Data ownership:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A3 | Feature envy | Per method: external objects with field accesses, grouped by object | 2+ accesses from same external object |
| A4 | Getter chains | Chained method calls through different objects | 3+ levels deep |

**Optional:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A5 | Optional handling | Every Optional variable with its handling pattern | Any `isPresent()`/`get()` pair |
| A5b | Nullable request fields | Fields in usecase request DTOs that are nullable instead of `Optional` with `@Builder.Default Optional.empty()` | Any nullable filter/parameter field in a request DTO (adapters wrap nulls at the boundary) |

**Repetition:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A6 | Repeated construction | `.builder()` or `new Type(...)` calls, grouped by type | Same type constructed 2+ times |
| A7 | Repeated expressions | Same sub-expression appearing in multiple places | 2+ occurrences |
| A7b | Near-duplicate blocks | Code blocks with identical structure but different literal values (same JSON template with different `status`/`amount`, same WireMock registration with different body). Group by structure, list the differing literals. | 2+ blocks sharing structure |

**Variables & lambdas:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A8 | Local variables | ALL local variables (single-use and multi-use). Classify each as *pass-through* (simple delegation used once: `var x = obj.field()`, `var x = privateMethod()`, `var x = staticMethod()` — the key is no injected dependency involved) or *computation* (conditional, ternary, multi-step expression, stream pipeline — any use count) or *side-effect isolation* (any call to an injected dependency — usecase, port, repository, API client — regardless of verb, whose result feeds a pure return/mapping). Only injected fields count as dependencies — private/static methods on the same class are NOT side-effecting. | Any local that is not side-effect isolation. Single-use pass-through → inline variable. Computation (any use count) → extract private method. **Side-effect isolation → KEEP** (never inline). |
| A9 | Lambda → method ref | Lambdas that delegate to a single constructor or method call | `x -> new Foo(x)`, `x -> bar(x)` |
| A32 | Inlined dependency calls | Calls to injected dependencies (usecase, port, repository, API client) nested inside expressions (return statements, method arguments, DTO factory calls) instead of isolated in their own local variable. Any call to an injected field is side-effecting regardless of verb — `getTasksByColumn()` hits the DB just like `save()` does. | Any dependency call nested inside another expression → extract to local variable |
| A25 | Replace Loop with Pipeline | For-loops over collections that can be replaced with stream pipelines (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `collect`, `reduce`, `anyMatch`, etc.). Includes loops that accumulate into a list, filter by condition, or transform elements. | Any for-loop replaceable by a collection pipeline |
| A27 | Inline multi-step pipeline | Stream/async pipelines (`IntStream.range().mapToObj().toArray()`, `.stream().map().filter().collect()`) written inline in a method that also does other work | Any inline pipeline with 2+ chained transformations in a method with other logic |
| A28 | Functional factory method | Methods returning `Runnable`, `Supplier`, `Callable`, or other functional interfaces where the body is a lambda wrapping imperative code | Any `return () -> { ... }` or `return () -> expr` |
| A29 | Commented sections | Comments followed by a code block followed by a blank line — each is a named concern that should be extracted | Any `// comment` + code block + blank line pattern |
| A30 | Blank line wrapped sections | Code blocks surrounded by blank lines without comments — each is an unnamed concern that should be extracted | Any blank line + code block + blank line pattern |
| A45 | Sequential independent blocks | Methods with 2+ sequential operations that don't share intermediate state and each handle a distinct concern (e.g., validate page, validate size, validate date range). Count independent blocks even without comments or blank lines separating them. | 2+ independent blocks in one method — extract each into a named method |

**Indirection:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A20 | Thin wrappers | Methods whose entire body is a single delegation to another method in the same class, passing only constants/hardcoded values. List each wrapper → target method + hardcoded args. | Any delegate-only method |
| A21 | Single-value parameters | Parameters that receive the same argument at every call site. For each method parameter, grep all callers. | Parameter always receives one value |
| A55 | Parameter derivable from sibling parameter | For each method with 2+ parameters of related types, check if any parameter's value is accessible from another parameter (e.g., `method(Task original, Title title)` where `title == original.getTitle()`). List the derivable parameter and the accessor path. | Any parameter obtainable from a sibling → remove it, use the accessor inside the method |

**Polymorphism & type dispatch:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A46 | `instanceof` in domain/usecase | Grep `instanceof` in domain and usecase source files. List each occurrence with file and line. | Any `instanceof` in domain or usecase → push behavior onto interface method, dispatch polymorphically |
| A47 | Re-partitioned base lists | `List<SealedBase>` or `List<InterfaceType>` that gets filtered/partitioned with `instanceof` downstream. List the field type and the instanceof filter location. | Any → replace with typed lists at creation time |
| A48 | Interleaved computation + side effects | Methods that alternate between computing results and calling external services (API, storage). List the interleaved calls. | Any → compute all results first, then try side effect, return original or error-mapped results |

**Cohesion & parameter groups:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A49 | Bloated entity / value object | Count fields. For each method, list which fields it accesses. Group fields by co-access patterns. | 10+ fields AND methods that use only a subset → extract cohesive value object for the field cluster |
| A50 | Repeating parameter group | Factory methods / constructors with 3+ parameters that appear together across 2+ call sites. List the repeated group. | Any → extract parameter object (record) and overload to accept it |
| A51 | External record rebuild | Code that constructs a new record/VO from an existing one, changing only 1-2 fields (copy all fields, override some). List the reconstruction site and the changed fields. | Any → add `toX()` transform method on the record itself |

**Usecase design** (skip if not a usecase class):

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A35 | Sequential storage port queries | Count injected storage/repository port fields. For each, check if data from one port feeds queries to another (N+1 pattern: fetch list → per item: fetch related data from another port). | 2+ storage ports queried sequentially — enrich aggregate, single port fetches everything upfront |
| A56 | Usecase-to-usecase dependency | List every injected field on the usecase. For each, classify its type: domain type, port interface, request DTO, clock/time source, other usecase. A type is "other usecase" if it lives under the usecase layer directory, is a concrete implementation (not a port interface), and itself orchestrates a user-visible operation. | Any other-usecase dependency → extract shared logic into the domain (entity method, value-object behavior, stateless domain service) or a non-usecase helper at the usecase layer; delete the usecase dependency |

**Storage adapter design** (skip if not a storage adapter class):

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A33 | Manual row grouping | See tech binding for ORM-specific patterns (grouping utilities, intermediate DTOs) in storage methods | Any manual row assembly — delegate mapping to ORM with proper entity relationships |
| A34 | Multi-repository injection | Count repository/data-access fields injected into a single storage class (see tech binding for patterns) | >1 repository dependency — consolidate into single query |
| A42 | Static query utility | Static class with methods that take a query/filter object and return framework query objects (see tech binding for patterns) | Any static utility building queries from a query object → move to adapter query class extending the port query |
| A43 | Untyped array query results | Index-based access to untyped query results (see tech binding for patterns) | Any → extract typed projection class with `toDomain()` |
| A44 | Inline query building in storage | Storage methods that build query/filter/pagination objects inline (see tech binding for patterns). Count lines of query-building logic vs actual storage work. | >5 lines of query building → extract AdapterQuery class extending port query |

**Imports:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A10 | Enum qualification | Enum constants used with class prefix in logic (not import lines) | Any `EnumClass.VALUE` |
| A36 | Repeated FQN | Fully-qualified class names (`com.foo.Bar`) appearing 2+ times in logic (not import lines). When the short name collides with an inner class, rename the inner class and import the external one. | Any FQN used 2+ times |

**Dead code:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A11 | Unused code | Private methods/fields with no call site in the file | Any unreferenced private member |
| A11b | `// Unreachable` markers | Grep `// Unreachable` in the file. These are dead code branches flagged by the coverage agent. | Any match → remove the dead branch and simplify the surrounding condition |

**Type safety:**

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A12 | Raw map usage | `Map.of(`, `Map<String, Object>`, `Map<String, String>` in production code | Any map standing in for typed data |
| A13 | Null/default args | Constructor, `of()`, `from()` calls listing arguments | Any null/default argument |
| A13b | Nullable domain value object | Domain value object constructor that accepts null (e.g., `if (value != null` guard instead of rejecting null). Also: domain entity fields typed as a value object but allowed to be null at construction time. | Any null-accepting constructor or nullable VO field in domain — use empty string, Optional, or Null Object pattern per `coding-rules.md` "No nulls in domain" |

**Sibling duplication** (any class extending a base or implementing same interface):

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A14 | Sibling duplication | Fields and methods appearing in 2+ sibling classes — read ALL siblings | Same member in 2+ siblings |

**Cross-class duplication** (not siblings — structurally identical but unrelated classes):

| # | Check | Enumerate | Violation |
|---|-------|-----------|-----------|
| A22 | Structurally identical classes | For each Fake or port interface, grep for other classes with identical method signatures and field structures. Example: `FakeTaskCreatedNotificationSender` and `FakeTaskMovedNotificationSender` both have `List<String> sentEmails` + `void send(String)`. | 2+ classes with identical structure → extract base class |
| A52 | Manual per-field assertion | Methods with 2+ sequential `assertThat(obj.fieldX())` lines comparing two objects field-by-field, or `assertAllFields`-style helpers. List the method name and field count. Classify each field: exact-match, non-deterministic (isNotNull/isNotEmpty), null-check, or custom (timestamp truncation, range). | All fields exact-match → `usingRecursiveComparison().isEqualTo(expected)`. Mixed strategies (some non-deterministic/null/custom) → extract reusable assertion helpers as private methods (HTTP status, timestamp, error structure), keep field-specific assertions in the parent. See `recursive-comparison.md` for decision guide. |
| A54 | Test helper duplicates production method | For each private/package method in the test class, check if a production class used in the test has a method with identical logic (same stream/filter/find pattern, same computation). Compare the test helper's body against methods on the objects it operates on — including private methods that could be made public. | Any match → make the production method accessible (public or package-private), delete the test helper, call the production method instead |
| A23 | Cross-Statements assertion duplication | For each `assert*` method in the target Statements class, grep all other `*Statements.java` for methods asserting the same domain concept (same response fields, same status checks). Example: asserting `in_progress` status + `assignee` + `priority` when `GetTaskStatusStatements.assertInProgressTask()` already exists. | Same domain assertion logic in 2+ Statements → delegate to existing Statements |
| A24 | Assertions in test class | Grep `assertThat\|assertThatThrownBy` in test class (not Statements). Example: `assertThatThrownBy(...)` or `assertThat(response.field())` directly in a test method instead of `statements.assertX(response)`. | Any assertion in test class → move to Statements method |
| A37 | Control flow in test class | Grep `for \|for(\|while \|while(\|if \|if(` in test methods (not Statements, not base class helpers). Example: `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { statements.assertField(i); }` directly in a test method. | Any loop or conditional in test class → extract to Statements method |
| A41 | Loops/conditionals computing expected values in tests | Grep `for \|for(\|if \|if(` combined with assertion or expected-value derivation in Statements. Loops for bulk data generation or collection assertions are fine. Example violation: `if (total > pageSize) { expected = total % pageSize; }` | Loops/conditionals that compute expected values or make branching assertions are production logic leaking into tests → replace with literal constants |
| A31 | Statements dependency count | Count `private final` fields in a Statements class — each is an injected dependency (usecases, other Statements, Fakes, Clock) | >8 dependencies → split Statements by concern |
| A38 | Middleman delegators between Statements | Methods in a Statements class whose entire body delegates to an injected Statements dependency (e.g., `void assertX() { otherStatements.assertX(); }`). List each wrapper → target Statements + method. | Any pass-through → remove method, have tests inject the target Statements directly |
| A39 | Implementation constants in test class | Grep for numeric literals (`\d+L`), `BigDecimal.valueOf`, `new .*Request`, technical constants (task IDs, column IDs, positions, offsets) passed as arguments to ANY Statements call (setup, action, or assertion) in test methods. Compare with the `@Description` — test code should match its Gherkin abstraction level. | Any implementation constants in test class → encapsulate inside the Statements method, return a record with values needed by subsequent calls. |
| A40 | Calculated expected values in tests | Grep `Math\.\|ceil\|floor` and arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) used to compute expected assertion values from runtime data in Statements or test classes. Example: `int expectedSize = (int) (totalElements - (lastPageNum - 1) * pageSize)`. | Any formula computing an expected value → tests must be dumb. Fix setup to produce deterministic data, then assert with literal constants. |
| A53 | Null assertion on domain VO field | Grep `isNull()` in Statements/test. For each match, check if the asserted expression traverses a domain entity or value object (e.g., `task.getDescription().getValue()`). | Any `isNull()` on a domain VO field → domain is null-free; fix the VO to reject null (empty string / Optional / Null Object), update assertion to match |

## Section B: Read-and-judge (cite evidence)

Read the code. Answer the question. **Cite the code snippet as evidence, or write "none found."** No bare "clean" allowed.

**Domain modeling:**

| # | Question | Evidence required |
|---|----------|------------------|
| B1 | Are there `String`/`int`/`long`/`UUID` parameters or fields that represent domain concepts (email, token, userId, amount)? | Quote the declaration |
| B2 | Are there String constants or parameters representing a fixed domain set (status, plan, type, period)? | Quote the usage |
| B3 | Are there persisted fields that could be computed from other fields in the same entity? | Quote the field + the fields it derives from |

**Behavior placement:**

| # | Question | Evidence required |
|---|----------|------------------|
| B4 | Is there validation logic in the wrong layer (usecase validating domain rules, controller with business logic)? | Quote the validation code |
| B5 | Does a caller check an object's fields then throw an exception? | Quote the `if` + `throw` block |
| B6 | Is there serialization, hashing, or formatting done outside the data object that owns the fields? | Quote the caller code |
| B7 | Are there consecutive find + validate sequences guarding the same concern? | Quote the guard block |
| B8 | Does a parent entity remove/add children in a collection directly instead of delegating to the child? | Quote the remove/add calls |
| B9 | Does a controller return a raw usecase/domain object without REST DTO wrapping? | Quote the return statement |

**Test-specific** (skip if not a test file):

| # | Question | Evidence required |
|---|----------|------------------|
| B10 | Do test helper methods use hardcoded values that should vary per test? | Quote the hardcoded value |
| B11 | Does the test create an object only to pass it to a single Statements method for assertion? | Quote the create + pass |

## Scan output format

**Print this filled checklist before starting refactoring.**

**Enumeration rule:** Every check that says "enumerate", "list", "count", or "for each" MUST show the enumerated data — even when clean. Write `→ clean` after the data shows no violation. Bare `[clean]` is only allowed for: (1) file-type skips (`[storage — skipped]`), (2) judgment checks (Section B) where the answer is "none found."
