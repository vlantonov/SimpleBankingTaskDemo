# Development Workflow

## Source Control

This project does **not** use pull requests or merge requests — commits land directly on the working branch. Never offer to open a PR/MR or invoke a platform's PR/MR CLI, and never reference "the PR description" as a place for context. Commit messages are the only review surface; put the *why* there.

## Lifecycle

Every story follows: **interview → spec → backend scenarios → integration scenarios → security scenarios → load scenarios → infrastructure scenarios**.

**High-level progress** is tracked in `ProductSpecification/stories.md` — three tables: **In Progress**, **Backlog**, and **Done**. Phase columns (Spec, Backend, Integration, Security, Load, Infra) per story. The `/continue` skill updates it after each work unit commit. Phase values: ✅ done, 🔧 in progress, — not started, · no story folder yet. When a story reaches 100% (all scenarios done), move its row from the **In Progress** table to the **Done** table.

**Backlog** stories have all `·` columns (no folder yet). When `/continue N` targets a Backlog story, auto-promote it: move the row from **Backlog** to **In Progress** in `ProductSpecification/stories.md` before starting work.

Spec phase: `/interview` → `/story` → `/api-spec` → `/test-spec` (one at a time, review each before proceeding).

## Backend Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/01_API_Tests.md`:

1. `red-acceptance` → `/red-acceptance` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
2. `design` → `/design-preview` → user approves (optionally with ADR) or escalates to `/architecture` → commit (if ADR produced)
3. `red-usecase` → `/red-usecase` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit
4. `green-usecase` → `/green-usecase` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → `/test-coverage usecase --focus` → commit
5. `adapters-discovery` → adapter discovery: identify ports and map to adapters, mark `[x] adapters-discovery`, insert concrete `red-adapter X` / `green-adapter X` steps below it (or `[S]` if no new adapters), commit progress.md
6. `red-adapter X` → `/red-adapter X` → `/test-review` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → commit (one per port)
7. `green-adapter X` → `/green-adapter X` → `/refactor` (MANDATORY) → `/test-coverage {adapter} --focus` → commit (one per port)
8. `green-acceptance` → `/green-acceptance` → commit

The `[ ] adapters-discovery` checkbox is a gate — it must be resolved before any subsequent step executes. The full procedure is in `.claude/templates/workflow/adapter-discovery-checklist.md`.

## Integration Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/06_Integration_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Integration scenarios cover cross-cutting concerns: scheduled jobs, webhook idempotency, resilience, and email triggers.

## Security Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/05_Security_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Security scenarios cover OWASP concerns: injection, rate limiting, mass assignment, and input validation.

## Load Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/03_Load_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Load scenarios cover performance and volume concerns: response time baselines, concurrent request handling, and large data set behavior.

## Infrastructure Scenario Sequence

For each scenario in `tests/04_Infrastructure_Tests.md` (if exists): same TDD cycle as backend scenarios above. Infrastructure scenarios cover resilience concerns: database failure handling, recovery after outages, and external service unavailability.

## Infrastructure & Port Configuration

Moved to `.claude/rules/infrastructure.md` (rules) and `.claude/tech/{backend}/templates/infrastructure/infrastructure-details.md` (full details).

## Progress Tracking

Each story has a progress file: `ProductSpecification/stories/NN-story-name/progress.md`.

### Status Markers

- `[x]` — done
- `[~]` — in-progress (current step)
- `[ ]` — pending
- `[S]` — skipped

### Reading Progress

When the user says "continue working on story X" or runs `/continue X`:
1. Read `ProductSpecification/stories/NN-story-name/progress.md`
2. Find the first `[ ]` or `[~]` entry — that is the next work unit
3. Report current status and what step will execute next

### Updating Progress

After completing a work unit:
1. Change `[~]` to `[x]` for the completed step
2. Change the next `[ ]` to `[~]` if continuing
3. Commit the progress file with the work unit commit

### Bootstrapping

If no `progress.md` exists, create one by:
1. Detecting spec artifacts in the story directory:
   - `interview`: check if `interview.md` exists
   - `story`: check if `NN_StoryName.md` exists
   - `api-spec`: check if `endpoints.md` exists
   - `test-spec`: check if `tests/01_API_Tests.md` exists
   - **Edge case**: if all spec items exist EXCEPT `interview.md`, mark `[S] interview (spec completed without interview)` — don't force retroactive interviews on old stories
2. Reading the story's test specs (`tests/01_API_Tests.md`, `tests/06_Integration_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/05_Security_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/03_Load_Tests.md` if exists, `tests/04_Infrastructure_Tests.md` if exists)
3. Scanning existing test classes and production code for completed steps
4. Marking completed steps as `[x]`, next step as `[~]`, rest as `[ ]`
5. For backend/integration/security scenarios, **always include `design` after `red-acceptance`** — it is mandatory for every scenario that needs new implementation. Only omit it when the entire scenario is `[S]` (existing implementation covers everything). Include `[ ] adapters-discovery` after `green-usecase` — adapter discovery runs when this step is reached.

## Atomic Work Units

A work unit is indivisible: ALL sub-skills in the dispatch sequence (primary skill → test-review → test-coverage → refactor → commit) must execute to completion before stopping. Within a work unit, never pause between sub-skills to report status or ask for confirmation. But after the commit that concludes the work unit, STOP — do not continue to the next work unit. The only valid stop points are: (1) after the commit, (2) on sub-skill failure. If a sub-skill fails, stop immediately and report — but a successful sub-skill must be followed by the next sub-skill in the sequence without interruption.

## Resuming Across Conversations

`progress.md` is the single source of truth for **state** — a new conversation reads it to know which work unit runs next. It does not capture the *why*: predictions that did not match, decisions made in discussion, surprises in existing code, approaches that failed. That context is lost when the user runs `/clear` or `/compact`.

**Journey summaries** preserve the why. They are written by the `/handoff` skill and read by `/continue` on resume — `/handoff` is the sole writer, `/continue` only reads. Run `/handoff` the moment you observe one of these worth-noting moments during work, rather than waiting for the end of the conversation; run it again before `/clear` or `/compact` as a final sweep. Do not spam it: `/handoff` fires only on a genuine trigger — a prediction mismatch, a decision reached in discussion, a surprise, a mistake worth not repeating, a quirk a future scenario will hit (the authoritative list is in `.claude/templates/workflow/summary-format.md` — "When to Write"). Never run it for routine progress that a future session can derive from `progress.md`, the commit, or the code. It is a targeted capture, not a periodic checkpoint. Capturing noteworthy material as it happens is why `/handoff` writes and `/continue` does not — the signal lives in the discussion and debugging, not in the work-unit artifacts. Because `/handoff` may run many times per conversation, it is idempotent: before appending it checks the summary file and skips any entry already recorded.

Summary files are append-only and created lazily: if a conversation had nothing noteworthy, no file is written, and "nothing to record" is a valid, common outcome. When a scenario's last step commits, `/handoff` promotes enduring codebase quirks to `carryover.md` at the story root so later scenarios inherit them.

See the `/handoff` and `/continue` skills for the mechanics (file layout, carryover promotion, reading on resume) and `.claude/templates/workflow/summary-format.md` for when to write an entry and the strict entry format.

# Task Workflow

Tasks are standalone work items that don't need the full story lifecycle. Three types:

- **bug** — Something is broken. Discover root cause first, then fix with a targeted TDD cycle.
- **refactoring** — Structural improvement. User-defined steps with standard TDD sub-skills.
- **qa** — Manual checklist (smoke / regression) verified against an external environment. No production code change, no TDD cycle.

Tasks live in `ProductSpecification/tasks/{N}-{type}-{slug}/`. Each task has a progress file at that path. When all checkboxes in a task's `progress.md` are `[x]` (or `[S]`), the task folder is moved to `ProductSpecification/tasks/done/`.

Bug and refactoring tasks follow the same TDD discipline as stories: `/test-review` after red phases, `/refactor` after every phase (except `green-acceptance`). Task commits use `task:` prefix. Tasks don't need bootstrapping -- `/task` generates everything at creation time.

## Bug Task Sequence (Discovery-First)

Bug tasks do NOT pre-plan TDD steps at creation time. The cause is usually unknown when the task is filed -- planning a full red/green/refactor sequence up front commits to assumptions that turn out wrong. Instead, every bug starts with discovery:

1. `reproduce in prod-copy` (prod-copy bugs only) — manually reproduce the bug in the prod-copy environment, confirm symptoms match the report, capture any unexpected behavior; progress-only commit
2. `root cause analysis` — locate the defect in the codebase, document findings (extend `spec.md` if the cause differs from the original write-up); progress-only commit
3. `steps discovery` — based on the root cause, determine which layers the fix touches and insert concrete TDD steps below this gate (`red-*`, `green-*`, etc.); commit progress.md

The `[ ] steps-discovery` checkbox is a gate -- it must be resolved before any subsequent TDD step executes. It is the bug-task analog of `[ ] adapters-discovery` in story scenarios.

**Why `reproduce in prod-copy` is a separate step:** prod-copy reproduction often surfaces details the original reporter omitted (exact request payload, header values, sequence of actions, downstream response). Doing it before root-cause analysis prevents wasted investigation on the wrong code path.

**Refactoring tasks are unaffected** by the discovery sequence — their steps are user-defined from the spec interview, since the scope is structural and known up front.

**Scoped steps (refactoring + story scenarios only):** Progress should only include TDD steps for layers the fix actually touches. If the fix is pure adapter wiring, don't generate usecase steps. Affected layers are determined from the spec at creation time. For bug tasks, layer scoping happens at `steps discovery`, not at creation.

## QA Task Sequence

QA tasks define a reusable manual checklist verified against an external environment (prod-copy, staging). Their lifecycle differs from bug/refactoring tasks in three ways:

- **No TDD, no dispatch.** `progress.md` checkboxes are not work units — each is a manual verification step performed by a human against the running service. `/continue` does NOT auto-dispatch QA cases; on a QA task it reports the next unchecked case and reminds the tester to run it by hand.
- **Session lifecycle.** `spec.md` is the immutable checklist definition (Cases section). `progress.md` mirrors those cases as `[ ]` checkboxes for the active test session. The tester ticks them as cases pass. To re-run for a new deploy, revive the task from `done/` and reset checkboxes — never edit `spec.md` to track sessions.
- **Failures file separate bug tasks.** When a case fails during a session, the checkbox stays `[ ]` and the tester creates a separate `/task bug` (prod-copy variant if reproduced there) for the failure. Never overload the checkbox with a fail marker — `[x]` means verified, `[ ]` means not yet verified or under investigation.

Commits use the `task:` prefix like other task types. Multiple cases may be ticked in a single commit (a smoke session is not work-unit-atomic the way TDD is).

Operational details: `/task` skill (creation, sections, progress format), `/continue` skill (execution, dispatch, adapter discovery, steps discovery).
